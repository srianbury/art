## I forked this repo from https://github.com/shortstack/art
### Goal for this repository:
Create a GitHub Page where you can easily copy the images.  These images are awesome and I thought this would be a fun project!!

# my "art"

all images in the `images` dir were drawn in Adobe Illustrator.

if you wish to print any of these in bulk, i recommend [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/). otherwise, you can find them on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/shortstack/collections/579066-zombies-ftw?asc=u/).
